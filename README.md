#ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

**Problem description**: 

In today’s fast-paced digital world, traditional banking systems often fall short in providing efficient, real
time, and user-friendly services to customers. Customers expect to perform basic banking operations—such 
as checking balances, transferring funds, viewing transaction history, and managing accounts—without 
having to visit a physical branch. 
However, many banking systems still rely on outdated technologies, which lack scalability, security, and 
accessibility. Moreover, with the growing threat of cyberattacks and data breaches, ensuring the safety and 
confidentiality of users' financial information has become a critical challenge. 
This project aims to address these issues by developing a secure, responsive, and feature-rich Online 
Banking System. It will allow users to manage their finances remotely through a web interface, offering 
core functionalities like account management, fund transfers, transaction history, and administrative 
controls for bank staff. The system will be built using Java-based web technologies and designed with best 
practices in software security, usability, and scalability.
